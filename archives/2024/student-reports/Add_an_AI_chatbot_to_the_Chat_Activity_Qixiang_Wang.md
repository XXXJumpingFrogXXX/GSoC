## The experienceüöÄ

During my participation in Google Summer of Code 2024, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project with Sugar Labs, focusing on enhancing the Chat Activity by developing a tailored AI chatbot for younger learners. This project was both challenging and rewarding, as it aimed to create an engaging and educational experience for children.

The main goal was to integrate a chatbot that could conduct conversations, efficiently retrieve knowledge, and guide young users through text-based games and activities. I designed customized prompts to ensure the chatbot resonated well with the youthful demographic, making interactions both fun and educational.

One of the significant achievements was successfully integrating the interactive chatbot into the Chat Activity, making it accessible in both Private and Neighbourhood modes. This feature greatly enriched the user experience, providing a platform that not only entertained but also educated our young community.

This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me the importance of designing user-centric applications. It was incredibly fulfilling to contribute to a project that supports learning and creativity for children.
